i was a flight risk with a fear of falling wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts i say can you believe it? as we're lying on the couch the moment i can see it yes yes i can see it now do you remember we were sitting there by the water? you put your arm around me for the first time you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter you are the best thing that's ever been mine flash forward and we're taking on the world together and there's a drawer of my things at your place you learn my secrets and you figure out why i'm guarded you say we'll never make my parents' mistakes but we got bills to pay we got nothing figured out when it was hard to take yes yes this is what i thought about do you remember we were sitting there by the water? you put your arm around me for the first time you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter you are the best thing that's ever been mine do you remember all the city lights on the water? you saw me start to believe for the first time you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter you are the best thing that's ever been mine oh-oh oh and i remember that fight 2:30 a.m as everything was slipping right out of our hands i ran out crying and you followed me out into the street braced myself for the goodbye 'cause that's all i've ever known then you took me by surprise you said i'll never leave you alone you said i remember how we felt sitting by the water and every time i look at you it's like the first time i fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter she is the best thing that's ever been mine hold on and make it last hold on never turn back (hold on) you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (hold on) you are the best thing that's ever been mine do you believe it? we're gonna make

the air was cold but something 'bout it felt like home somehow and i left my scarf there at your sister's house and you've still got it in your drawer even now oh your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze we're singing in the car getting lost upstate autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place and i can picture it after all these days and i know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more and i might be okay but i'm not fine at all 'cause there we are again on that little town street you almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me wind in my hair i was there i remember it all too well photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed and your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team you told me 'bout your past thinking your future was me and you were tossing me the car keys f- the patriarchy keychain on the ground we were always skipping town and i was thinking on the drive down any time now he's gonna say it's love you never called it what it was 'til we were dead and gone and buried check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same after three months in the grave and then you wondered where it went to as i reached for you but all i felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame and i know it's long gone and there was nothing else i could do and i forget about you long enough to forget why i needed to 'cause there we are again in the middle of the night we're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light down the stairs i was there i remember it all too well and there we are again when nobody had to know you kept me like a secret but i kept you like an oath sacred prayer and we'd swear to remember it all too well well maybe we got lost in translation maybe i asked for too much but maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up running scared i was there i remember it all too well and you call me up again just to break me like a promise so casually cruel in the name of being honest i'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here 'cause i remember it all all all they say all's well that ends well but i'm in a new hell every time you double-cross my mind you said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine and that made me want to die the idea you had of me who was she? a never-needy ever lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you not weeping in a party bathroom some actress asking me what happened you that's what happened you you who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes sipping coffee like you're on a late night show but then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you to come and he said it's supposed to be fun turning 21 time won't fly it's like i'm paralyzed by it i'd like to be my old self again but i'm still trying to find it after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own now you mail back my things and i walk home alone but you keep my old scarf from that very first week 'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me you can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well yeah 'cause there we are again when i loved you so back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known it was rare i was there i remember it all too well wind in my hair you were there you remember it all down the stairs you were there you remember it all it was rare i was there i remember it all too well and i was never good at telling jokes but the punchline goes i'll get older but your lovers stay my age from when your brooklyn broke my skin and bones i'm a soldier who's returning half her weight and did the twin flame bruise paint you blue? just between us did the love affair maim you too? 'cause in this city's barren cold i still remember the first fall of snow and how it glistened as it fell i remember it all too well just between us did the love affair maim you all too well? just between us do you remember it all too well? just between us i remember (just between us) it all too well wind in my hair i was there i was there down the stairs i was there i was there sacred prayer i was there i was there it was rare you remember it all too well wind in my hair i was there i was there down the stairs i was there i was there sacred prayer i was there i was there it was rare you remember it wind in my hair i was there i was there down the stairs i was there i was there sacred prayer i was there i was there it was rare you remember it wind in my hair i was there i was there

anticipating my face in a red flush i don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch everybody wants you everybody wonders what it would be like to love you walk past quick brush i don't like slow motion double vision in rose blush i don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush everybody wants you but i don't like a gold rush what must it be like to grow up that beautiful? with your hair falling into place like dominoes my mind turns your life into folklore i can't dare to dream about you anymore at dinner parties i won't call you out on your contrarian ways and the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it 'cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea 'cause it will never be gleaming twinkling eyes like sinking ships on waters so inviting
